About this program
This program is an SDK client program that connects to the Hansoft server and exports a Hansoft report or find query to Excel.  This is similar
to what you can do in the Hansoft client but this utility is primarily useful if you, for example using the Windows Task Scheduler, want to do
the export regularly and then the exported data is then prepared for presentation using, e.g., an Excel Macro. Note that to use this program you need
to have the SDK option enabled on your Hansoft Server and also have an SDK user created in your database.

There is some help displayed if you invoke the program without specifying any parameters. See also below.

This utility exports all active columns without sorting or grouping regardeless of if that is specified in a report given as a parameter.

The columns will be exported in the following order:
* The non-hidable builtin columns. These columns are different depending on what view (agile, scheduled, QA, Product Backlog) you are exporting. 
* Active hidable builtin columns
* Active custom columns

Building the program
The program is built with the freely available Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop). The export to Excel is done
via EPPlus which is freely available here: http://epplus.codeplex.com/ and you will need to download that separately and change the references
to the EPPlus DLL in the Visual Studio Project as needed. You will also need the Hansoft SDK yo be able to build the program, found here:
http://hansoft.se/Solutions/sdk-integrations/download-sdk-integrations.html. You will also need to update the references to the appropriate 
Hansoft SDK DLL in the Visual Studio project (typically: HPMSdkManaged.x86) and make sure that the Hansoft SDK DLL (typically HPMSdk.x86.dll) is
in the same directory as your executable.

Usage
hsexp -c<server>:<port>:<database>:<sdk user>:<sdk password> -p<project>:[a|s|b|q] -r<report>:<user>|-f<query> -o:<file>

This utility exports the data of a Hansoft report or a Find query to Excel. All active columns in Hansoft will be exported
regardless of what columns that has been defined to be visible in the report. There is no guruantueed column order but the
order will be the same as long as the set of active columns remain unchanged. If any sorting or grouping is defined in the
report this will also be ignored.

If any parameter values contain spaces, then the parameter value in question need to be double quouted. Colons are not
allowed in parameter values.

Options -c, -p, and -o must always be specified and one of the options -r and-f must also be specified.

-c Specifies what hansoft database to connect to and the sdk user to be used
<server>       : IP or DNS name of the Hansoft server
<port>         : The listen port of the Hansoft server
<database>     : Name of the Hansoft Database to get data from
<sdk user>     : Name of the Hansoft SDK User account
<sdk password> : Password of the Hansoft SDK User account

-p Specifies the Hansoft project and view to get data from
<project>      : Name of the Hansoft project
a              : Get data from the Agile project view
s              : Get data from the Scheduled project view
b              : Get data from the Product Backlog
q              : Get data from the Qaulity Assurance section

-r Get the data of a Hansoft report
<report>       : The name of the report
<user>         : The name of the user that has created the report

-f Get the data of a Hansoft find query
<find>         : The query
Note: if the query expression contains double quoutes, they should be replaced with single quoutes when using this utility.

-o Specifies the name of the Excel output file
<file>         : File name


Examples:
Find all high priority bugs in the project MyProject in the database My Database where the server is running on the localmachine
on port 50257, save the output to the file Bugs.xslx:

hsexp -clocalhost:50257:"My Database":sdk:sdk -pMyProject:q -f"Bugpriority='High priority'" -oBugs.xlsx

Export all items from the report PBL (defined by Manager Jim) in the product backlog of the project MyProject in the database
My Database found on the server running on the local machine at port 50257:

hsexp -clocalhost:50257:"My Database":sdk:sdk -pMyProject:b -rPBL:"Manager Jim" -oPBL.xlsx
